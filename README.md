# Simulation and Manual PCB Layout

AIM

To create a schematic, simulate, and manually layout the PCB for a simple circuit.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Design a circuit of your choice in any simulation software. Upon successful simulation, draw the PCB layout of the designed circuit.

EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED

Proteus 8 Professional

### STEPS
1) Choose the desired components for your design.

2) Place all components and make the necessary connections.

3) After making all the connections, click the run button to start the simulation.

4) Finally, manually draw the PCB layout for the circuit.
